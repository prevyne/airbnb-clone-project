    GraphQL: Offers a flexible and efficient query mechanism for interacting with the backend.

2. User Authentication
    Endpoints: /users/, /users/{user_id}/

4. Booking System
    Endpoints: /bookings/, /bookings/{booking_id}/
    Features: Make, update, and manage bookings, including check-in and check-out details.

5. Payment Processing
    Endpoints: /payments/
    Features: Handle payment transactions related to bookings.

6. Review System
    Endpoints: /reviews/, /reviews/{review_id}/
    Features: Post and manage reviews for properties.

7. Database Optimizations
    Indexing: Implement indexes for fast retrieval of frequently accessed data.
    Caching: Use caching strategies to reduce database load and improve performance.

# API Security
1. Authentication
     -Strong Password Policies
        a. Enforcement: Require users to create strong passwords (minimum length, combination of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters).
        b. Hashing and Salting: Never store passwords in plain text. Instead, use strong, one-way cryptographic hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) with unique salts for each password. This makes it virtually impossible to reverse-engineer passwords even if the database is compromised.
        c. Password Complexity Rules: Guide users to create strong passwords during registration.
    
    -Session Management
        a. Secure Tokens: Use secure, short-lived session tokens (e.g., JWTs) that are signed and encrypted.
        b. Expiration and Revocation: Implement session expiration and the ability to revoke sessions (e.g., on password change, logout from all devices).
        c. Secure Cookies: Store session tokens in HttpOnly and Secure cookies to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks from accessing them.

    -Identity Verification(KYS- Know your customer)
        a. For Hosts: Implement a robust identity verification process for hosts (e.g., government ID upload, facial recognition/liveness checks). This helps build trust and reduce fraudulent listings.
        b. For Guests (Optional but Recommended for High-Value Bookings): Consider similar verification for guests for certain booking types or if suspicious activity is detected.

2. Authorization
    -Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
        a. Defined Roles: Clearly define roles (e.g., Guest, Host, Admin).
        b. Permissions: Assign specific permissions to each role (e.g., Guest can book properties, Host can list properties and manage bookings for their properties, Admin can manage all users, listings, and bookings).
        c. Granular Control: Implement granular permissions, meaning an action is only allowed if the user's role has the necessary permission for that specific resource.

    -Secure API endpoints
        a. Authentication & Authorization Checks: Every API endpoint handling sensitive operations or data must perform both authentication (is the user who they say they are?) and authorization (is this user allowed to do this action?).
        b. Least Privilege: Ensure that users and systems are granted only the minimum necessary permissions to perform their tasks.

    -Rate Limiting
        a. Prevention of Brute-Force Attacks: Limit login attempts, password reset requests, and API calls to prevent automated attacks.
        b. Denial-of-Service (DoS) Protection: Prevents a single malicious actor from overwhelming the server with an excessive number of requests, ensuring availability for legitimate users.
        c. Resource Throttling: Prevents abuse of specific resource-intensive endpoints (e.g., search, image uploads) that could degrade performance for others.
        d. Scraping Prevention: Makes it harder for bots to scrape large amounts of data from the platform.
        e. Implementation Strategies:
            - Per IP Address: Limit requests from a single IP.
            - Per User/API Key: More effective for authenticated actions, as it ties the limit to a specific user account.
            - Time Windows: Define limits over specific periods (e.g., 100 requests per minute, 1000 requests per hour).
            - Dynamic Rate Limiting: Adjust limits based on server load or detected suspicious activity.
            - HTTP 429 "Too Many Requests": Return this status code when a client exceeds the rate limit, often including Retry-After headers.

# CI/CD Pipeline Overview
    -Definition
        CI/CD pipelines are automated processes used in software development to streamline the creation, testing, and deployment of applications.Continuous Integration (CI) involves frequently merging code changes into a central repository, allowing early detection of issues. Continuous Delivery (CD) or Continuous Deployment (CD) automates the application's release to its intended environment, ensuring that it is readily available to users.

    -Docker
        - Containerization tool for consistent development and deployment environments.
    -GitHub Actions
        - GitHub Actions is a platform that allows you to automate build, test, and deployment pipelines, as well as other tasks in your software development lifecycle. It enables you to create workflows that run automatically in response to specific events, such as pushing code to a repository, opening a pull request, or creating an issue.
